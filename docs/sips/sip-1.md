## What is a SIP?

SIP stands for Subjektify Improvement Proposal. A SIP is a design document providing information to the Subjektify community, or describing a new feature for Subjektify or its processes or environment. The SIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The SIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## History

This document was derived heavily from Ethereum's EIP-0001 written by Alex Beregszaszi which in turn was derived from Bitcoin's BIP-0001 written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from Python's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified.
